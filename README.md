# STM32-Bootloader
This project implements a custom bootloader for the STM32G071RB microcontroller using STM32CubeIDE. The bootloader is capable of jumping to a main application located at a defined memory address and includes a shared API interface that allows the application to call bootloader functions directly via a fixed memory location.
